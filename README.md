# UBIT
A Universal Bio-Informatics Tool for solving totally everyday problems.


Perform Global Alignment<br />
[] Perform Local Alignment<br />
[]	Transcribe complementary DNA<br />
[]	Transcribe mRNA sequence from complementary DNA<br />
[]	Finally generate the Protein Sequence <br />
[]	Calculate the Hamming Distance<br />
[x]	Devise the possible k-mers from the given DNA Sequence<br />
[]	% Mass composition of nucleotides in DNA<br />
