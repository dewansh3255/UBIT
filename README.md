# UBIT
A Universal Bio-Informatics Tool for solving totally everyday problems.

## Goals
- [x] Perform Global Alignment

- [x] Transcribe complementary DNA
- [x] Transcribe mRNA sequence from complementary DNA
- [x] Finally generate the Protein Sequence
- [x] Calculate the Hamming Distance
- [x] Calculate the Levenshtein Distance
- [x] Devise the possible k-mers from the given DNA Sequence
- [x] % Mass composition of nucleotides in DNA
- [ ] % Mass composition of Amino Acid in generated Protein Sequence
- [x] Create a Neural Network to compare and the closest matching Protein Sequence with existing database
- [x] All the above presented in Enhanced Graphical Interface
